# node_portfolio
## Date Start : 7/7/2022

This is my first web portfolio. This portfolio was created with HTML, CSS / Bootstrap, JavaScript for the client end. For the server side, this uses mySQL, NodeJS/ExpressJS, and handlebars to store and render information from database. This portfolio shows my professional work history, education, and my contact information. The purpose of this portfolio is to show a full stack project that uses ExpressJS to set up server and uses the MVC model to organized folders and files. Finally, this project was deploy to Heroku and uses ClearDB to connect to database.
